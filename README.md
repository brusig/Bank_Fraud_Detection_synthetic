# Bank_Fraud_Detection_synthetic

Supervised ML model to detect fraudulent bank transactions. Made using synthetic data.

Quite a different project, due to the fraudulent transactions only accounting for 0.12% of all transactions.

The notebook is a step by step in creating a ml model, including finding which classifier suits our goal the most!

To run, download the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1/download?datasetVersionNumber=2) and add it to the data folder. (Too big to host here)

Made during my time at Nod Bootcamp 2022.
